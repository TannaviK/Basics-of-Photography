    <h4>Apperture | ISO |  Shutter Speed</h4>
    <p>The Apperture sets the amount of light that enters through the octagonal shaped blades of the lens.
      <br>Low Apperture values means a higher f-stop. Therefore, more light enters the lens, generating greater <a href="adj_exposure.html">Exposure </a> in the photograph.
      <br>Low Apperture also means more depth of field and the expectation of seeing Bokeh effects, and such.
      <br>Stay tuned for more updates on the various effects you can see in images, and photoshop tutorials!

  <div class="text-block">
      <h4>ISO</h4>
    <p>The ISO is the amount of brightness in your end photo result, and is used to change <a href="adj_exposure.html">Exposure </a>very often.
      <br>High ISO causes a lot of unappreciated <a href="adj_noise.html">Noise </a> in the photograph.
      <br>Hence, it is usually the last resort in low light photography.

  <div class="text-block">
      <h4>Shutter Speed</h4>
    <p>The Speed of the shutter allows light to fall into the sensor for a controllable fraction of a second.
      <br>High shutter speed values are used for sports and action photography. It usually makes images have more clarity as well as more is in focus.
      <br>Image stablilisation in a lot of cameras has helped with this setting as high shutter speeds means less light enters.
